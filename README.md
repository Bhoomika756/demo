HANGMAN
The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game implemented using Python. This console-based application allows a user to guess a hidden word one letter at a time. The player is given a fixed number of attempts to guess the correct word. Each incorrect guess results in one part of the "hangman" being drawn, and the game ends when the word is guessed correctly or the drawing is complete.
